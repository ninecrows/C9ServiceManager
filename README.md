# C9ServiceManager
Facilitate the timed management of windows service activity. Sandbox service project with web UI.

This is a small sandbox project.

The code implements (or will implement) a windows service in C# that
monitors other services and based on the time enables or disables each service.

I expect that in the final implementation it will expose a web UI for
checking and modifying configuration and a RESTful interface that
allows external programmatic control.
